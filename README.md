# SNHU-CS-370

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project.**<br />
With this project I was given the code to give a visual representation of the maze as well as the code to allow the agent to move around the maze. There is also code to run the agent through a full game, a function to check that the maze is solvable and the code to build the neural network. I added the code to complete the Q - Training algorithm which allows the agent to find the optimum navigation route for the maze by testign out different routes till it was able to achieve a 1005 win rate in an epoch.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**<br />
Computer scientists solve problems with the assistance of computer systems, these problems might be newly arisen or they might be innovative new ways to do things that are improvements over older methods but as our society moves forward we see more and more problems being solved with computer innovation being driven by computer science.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**<br />
When looking at a problem I first look at all the requirements for the solution, and come up with tests that will ensure that the requirements are being met. After this I begin to develop a system to meet the requirements and should be able to meet the tested for parameters. I would then present this completed product to the end users and see that it meets their expectations.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**<br />
My responsibilities to the end user and organization ethically are to create software that first and foremost meets the requirements given by the end user. Beyond this it is important that the program does not do anything that the end user is not aware of or does not give consent for the program to do. It's also important to ensure that the program is not collecting any information that the user is not aware of. In all my responsibilites can be condensed by sayint that I need to ensure that any program I create is not designed to take advantage of the end user for my own gain without their knowledge.
