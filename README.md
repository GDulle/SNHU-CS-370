**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project.**<br />
With this project I was given the code to give a visual representation of the maze as well as the code to allow the agent to move around the maze. There is also code to run the agent through a full game, a function to check that the maze is solvable and the code to build the neural network. I added the code to complete the Q - Training algorithm which allows the agent to find the optimum navigation route for the maze by testing out different routes till it was able to achieve a 100% win rate in an epoch.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**<br />
Computer scientists are first and foremost problem solvers in a digital world. In a world that is seeing computers being integrated into almost every facet of it at a rapid pace computer scientists are solving problems and answering questions that are being asked more and more frequently from areas that have not had to deal with computer integration till now. Computer scientists make many of the advances that society has seen since the first computer possible and it's exciting to see where this field will go in the future. It would not be outside the realm of possibility that for the foreseeable future many advances will come from the integration of machine learning like that done in this project.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**<br />
When looking at a problem I first look at all the requirements for the solution, and come up with tests that will ensure that the requirements are being met. After this I begin to develop a system to meet the requirements and should be able to meet the tested for parameters. I would then present this completed product to the end users to evaluate that it meets their expectations.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**<br />
My responsibilities to the end user and organization ethically are to create software that first and foremost meets the requirements given by the end user. Beyond this it is important that the program does not do anything that the end user is not aware of or does not give consent for the program to do. My responsibilites can be summed up by saying that I need to ensure that any program I create is not designed to take advantage of the end user for my own gain without their knowledge.
